DHH: Hey, this is David Heinemeier Hansson. Welcome to On Writing Software Well, Episode 4. Today I want to talk about all the kind of stuff that you could have in your models in a Rails application that's not an active record. I have the sense that people sometimes confuse where to actually put things in a Rails application and they kind of think that the only thing that goes in app models is active records, that's models backed by a database, or concerns. We talked about concerns in a couple of the previous episodes. And that's not true. We use a bunch of just plain old Ruby objects in our app models directory in Basecamp. And I wanted to basically just show one of those models, walk through it, walk through a particular feature that uses both this concept of the concerns where we're using the wonderful feature of Ruby, the mixin, to factor out a piece of the logic on a model and give it a home. And then also at the same time use sort of composition or delegation and have a dedicated object to deal with a single consideration. And you can really mix these things together very well. I find that the concerns gives you a way of viewing the application through a fewer set of primary models that have a broader base of logic in it. A lot of people don't really like that. They talk about surface area as being a major consideration. That if an object has too many methods on it, that means that by definition is bad. Well, if you look at Rails itself and look at some of the core classes, some of those objects have hundreds of methods on them. And it's not really a problem. If you look at some of the standard library classes in Ruby itself, count how many methods live on string. Quite a lot of them, right? Well, in Basecamp and in most other actual applications, I find it's even easier to live with a broad surface area around a set of core models because we get to factor these considerations out and group them in a way where when we're reading about them and going through the source code, they can sort of logically be cohesive. Even if the model itself, if you just looked at the methods on it, doesn't appear to be cohesive because it's mixing in a bunch of different things. When you're actually reading through the source code, it's very cohesive. And then when you get to use it, you're using, say, a user model or a messages model in a way where it's a very natural API, which is something I've always cared deeply about. It's not just about how the code reads when you're defining it. It's also how the code reads when you're using it. And I find that mixins combined with backing classes really does that combination well. In any case, let's look at a specific feature. So the feature we're going to look at today is an aspect or a concern of the user's model. We're going to look at how this user model can act as a notifier. In one of the previous episodes, we talked about mentions. And mentions is a way of notifying someone about something in the application. You mention someone in a comment or in a chat line, and they get a notification. Well, the flip side of that is who acts in that role as someone who can be mentioned? Well, a notifier does. What is a notifier? That is an aspect of the user in Basecamp. Users in Basecamp is sort of part of this two-phase setup. It's a personable. We have also this concept of a person that is separate from a user. A person can have a user, can be a user. We use sort of composition delegation for that. But they can also be other things. We have, for example, clients. And then we have tombstones, which is a way of representing a deleted user or person in the system. In any case, let's focus on the user and let's focus on the concern of being a notifier. As you can see here, this follows the same sort of pattern as we talked about earlier in the earlier episodes about concerns. But the concern here is really slim. It is basically there to provide a nice user interface such that we can say something like current.user.notifications and then do something with it, right? Rather than the more awkward form of directly accessing this regular class that we have with a notifications.new and then passing in the current user. That's just not a very elegant API. For me, at least, it's well worth adding this concern just to have this nicer notation, this nicer API when we then reference it in controllers or wherever else we want to deal with this notification concern. But as I said, there's not actually a lot here, right? We're basically just providing this pathway to this class, which as you can see, doesn't actually inherit from anything. It is not a parent or it's not using inheritance in any way. It's using composition. It's basically just a vanilla class in Ruby that serves to provide a couple of things to sort of itself and then another layer of composed classes from there. The main thing it provides is a aggregation of all the considerations we have around notifications. You can see we have this notion of notifications in Basecamp being snoozed, that you don't want the notifications for a certain amount of time. We have this idea of platforms. Where can you receive the notifications? You can receive them on your native app. You can receive them on email and so forth. And then you also have a schedule, whether you want to invoke the work and wait setup that we have in Basecamp, where you're just basically not notified on off hours, which is a wonderful feature. In any case, what I'm going to dig into here is one of these aspects, which is granularity. As you can see, as I said, this class just provides this Redis connection, then it provides the interface to these specific classes and it passes itself into these subclasses. We get this falling tree where we start with the user who acts as a notifier, who then has the notifications. We dig into the notifications and then we dig into the granularity. When we get into the granularity, you see it's basically another plain old Ruby class that takes this notifications object as its only parameter during instantiation. But then, since we have this notifications parameter, we can delegate a certain amount of stuff to it. In this case, all we need from it is the user, that's all the way back up the tree, and we need the Redis connection because that's where we're going to store our settings. Actually, if I take you over here to Safari, I can show you what this looks like in the app itself. You see, this is the screen that controls the notification settings and where it can wait. What is basically the granularity? It is whether you want notifications about everything, any time new messages are posted or comments or something, or you sign something. Do you want a push notification? Do you want something else like that? Or, as I have it set actually, do you only want a notification when someone is pinging you or is mentioning you? Down here we have other controls. This is, for example, the schedule and we have the snoozing and we have all these other considerations for how you get notifications. But what is backing this aspect of this form is this notion of granularity. Granularity right now just comes as a two-faced choice. You can either get pings and mentions or you can get everything. There's not really a lot to it, it's really just a bit either way. We sort of set it up in this way, a little bit in a sort of you're not going to need it way, in an extensible way. I believe we actually had a third choice at one point. We were considering whether to perhaps just deal with pings or mentions and separate things. In any case, we still need a class to encapsulate this setting and this allows us to do it. Because what this class encapsulates is not only the setting of the granularity for notifications, but then also the check when we send out notification as whether they're allowed under the granularity rules. This is what this allows method actually does. It takes a deliverable. A deliverable is a certain form of notification. It could be a mentions, it could be an assignment, it could be any of these things that we notify people about in Basecamp. Obviously, if you're set to want every kind of deliverable as a notification, everything is allowed. Otherwise, we check whether this deliverable is a mentioned or whether it's a ping. It's really pretty self-explanatory in that sense. What's interesting here too is this way we're using Redis to store the choice. As I said, this is not backed by a database, it's not backed by ActiveRecord or something else like that, which is an interesting discussion. We've talked about internally at Basecamp quite a lot. When do we use Redis? When do we use the database? What we've come to the conclusion of is we want to use a database when we have a store of record in terms of when content is posted to Basecamp. That would be the messages and files and whatever. That feels like it has a different level of criticality to it than say a settings of whether an individual person wants pings, mentions or whatever. If we somehow lost this setting, it wouldn't be the end of the world. You can very easily set that again. We don't want to lose this and we do all sorts of things to not lose it, but it is a tier below the grade of criticality of losing an important file that's been uploaded. That's just the thought process we've gone through in how to use Redis these days. I'd say Redis is plenty stable. You're saving your data. It's not just an in-memory store. The line is not as clearly drawn as it perhaps was at some point in the past. In any case, what's interesting here too is we're sort of using the scope from the fact that notifications has its own namespace in the Redis setup and in the Redis connection. We also have a way through this Redis connectable of basically assigning this namespace to a whole different instance. We have several instances of Redis that we run. Some of them for performance reasons and others for scaling reasons. It's just easier to be able to assign a certain feature to a certain set of Redis clusters. Then we can go through there. Then we have the fact that notifications provides the umbrella of all these settings and configurations around notification. Then granularity is this one step below that. That's what the granularity key provides. We take the master key from notifications. This is also an interesting thing here. We use send because if we go back and look in notifications, the user key is private. This leads us to one of those funny trade-offs where someone who's interfacing with notifications, which again they can do through just user because the notifyee concern exposes notifications directly, has access to schedule and snooze and platform. We don't really want them to have access to the Redis key. That's sort of too low level. That's private and that makes sense. Then we're using this composition setup and all of a sudden now we have this granularity class that actually does need access to the Redis user key that we got from notifications. What should we do? We have two trade-offs. On the one hand this feels wrong. It feels wrong that we're using send to basically bypass the privacy of a specific method but on the other hand is it better to make it public and then as part of the public interface and then you sort of expect that maybe you should be able to call it in a controller? That doesn't seem right either. These are the design considerations that I love to look at when you have two opposing trade-offs again where on the one hand it says well you shouldn't be calling send because you shouldn't be calling private methods and other classes and on the other hand we have this notion of we don't want these internals to be public in other users. In this instance I've decided to basically say screw it. This is the lesser of two evils. It is the lesser evil to have this class that's related to it which sort of kind of is a bit of a subclass. It's at least within the domain of notifications. Maybe this is something that you could sort of say is almost like a protected method. Ruby doesn't really give us this capability of using it this way because we're not in an inheritance tree. We're using composition here. In any case not a big deal. General rule yes you shouldn't be calling private methods on other classes. Specific context here is that that is still the better choice of the two options that we have. Then we can go over and have a look at how this is actually then used in the settings controller. This settings controller is the controller that's backing this screen as we just looked at which needs to update a bunch of different things which on the one screen looks like it's all the same. It's actually like three four or five different considerations. We have the different updates here. Update is a composed method in the sense we have to update five different things, potentially five different things. We don't want to do all that in line even though the calls are pretty simple. We're composing this method into five different steps. Well for this the only thing we're going to look at here is update granularity and as you can see we're just going straight to the current user, the notifications through the notifier concern and setting the granularity choice to the granularity parameter and that's really all there is to it. As soon as we set this choice you can see we have the class here call regis straight away so there's not even been saved that needs to happen in that case. That's basically it but it's just a good reminder that this isn't an either or. It's not that everything should be a concern and you should shove all sorts of logic into just concerns alone which really wasn't the case I had presented either when you looked at the episode about mentions which was also a concern but relied on two classes to do the actual work. We have the eavesdropper and we have the scanner which is quite similar in this case that we have both a notifications aggregate class and then we have a granularity class that encapsulates just this one aspect of it and that's a way where you really end up basically quite close to the sort of prevailing wisdom of cohesion and encapsulation even if it appears as though concerns break to some extent both of these considerations. It really only does it under a shallow loop when you're not really looking at the depth of this and not really looking all the way down and comparing and contrasting the different options to it. I'm doing this to get the nicer API. Having a beautiful simple API is worth a lot so it's worth bending the rules and bending the considerations for a bit and there we go.
